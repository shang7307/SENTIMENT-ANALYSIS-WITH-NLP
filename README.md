Task Description: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

The objective of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is used to identify and classify the emotional tone of text data, such as determining whether a customer review expresses a positive or negative opinion.

In this task, a dataset containing customer reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels is used. The process begins with text preprocessing, which includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, and eliminating common stopwords. These steps help clean the text and improve the quality of features extracted from the reviews.

After preprocessing, the cleaned text data is transformed into numerical form using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. TF-IDF measures the importance of words in a document relative to the entire dataset, allowing meaningful features to be extracted for machine learning models.

A Logistic Regression classifier is then trained using the TF-IDF features. Logistic Regression is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for text classification tasks due to its efficiency and reliability. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.

The trained model is used to predict the sentiment of test reviews, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and classification report. This task demonstrates the complete workflow of sentiment analysis, from preprocessing and feature extraction to modeling and evaluation, and highlights the practical application of NLP techniques in analyzing customer feedback.
